                    started with us. It started with the idea of making something real with the abstract existence of doing calculations (in a certain way, it's a 
                    genre of thinking) using mental labor. The idea of “Inventing another mind just like us or probably better than us” just came after that. People have 
                    fantasized about creating a non-human intelligent object or life for a long time. We even call ourselves 
                    <span class="text_hover">“Homo Sapiens"</span><img class="image_hover image_hover2" src="./assets/2_human.jpeg"/>
                    or The Wise Man”; intelligence resides in why we become so eminent in survival. The master craftsman attempted to create the same for centuries, certainly in a different way for different 
                    purposes. And only recently, we have achieved a somewhat close result which was deemed impossible some centuries ago.
                    My ambition with this write is to clearly and with an open mind explore “what artificial intelligence is,” “to give philosophical and scientific credentials 
                    of what it is and becoming," and finally, most important, how it became what it is today.” Before starting with everything, by answering if 
                    “artificial intelligence is a threat or not” to “why it came into existence.” And study the philosophical aspects of artificial intelligence. We should 
                    answer the most certain question “What is intelligence?” and then “What is artificial?”.

                    <span class="text_hover">Mind</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/3_mind.jpg"/>
                    ? What is Intelligence? These questions have tantalized philosophers for millennia. Intelligence, in the most basic way, is the ability to 
                    learn, understand, and apply knowledge. Defining and coming up with a single agreeable definition is unreachable to an extent because of its complex 
                    abstract concept. Likewise, the Mind is also a similar complex abstract concept.<a href="#bib1" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib1')"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">What is Artificial?</h3>
                    &nbsp &nbsp Artificial is something that is created by humans rather than occurring naturally. It can be a simple tool to a very complex mechanical machine.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp With these questions, we can conclude what we mean by Artificial Intelligence. AI is an artificial form of intelligence. We try to put intelligence 
                    into a man-made instrument. Thus, fulfilling the desire to become a god in some sense (hahaha).

                    Before going through the history of artificial intelligence briefly, I want to point out the differences between Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. 
                    For general talking, we have short-formed 
                    <span class="text_hover">artificial intelligence to AI</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/4_ai.jpeg"/> and 
                    <span class="text_hover">artificial life to Alife</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/5_alife.png"/>
                    . “ALife is the bottom-up scientific study of the 
                    fundamental principles of life,” as mentioned in one article by The Gradient.<a href="#bib2" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib2')"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                     The difference is in ALife; humans are trying to create life from scratch, 
                    not just creating a silicon-based intelligence.

                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Let's talk about some succulent content.
                    The notion of AI or ALife has been around for centuries, and it can be investigated in plenty of fiction and ancient texts. Some earliest attempts at the 
                    same can be found in ancient 
                    <span class="text_hover">Greek mythology</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/6_greekm.webp"/>
                    . Ovid's narrative poem 
                    Metamorphoses<a href="#bib3" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib3')"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
                    expresses the love of Pygmalion, a Cypriot sculptor, for his statue, 
                    Galatea, which came into existence after watching the Propoetides of Cyprus practicing prostitution. On Aphrodite's festival day, the king, Pygmalion, 
                    asks the Aphrodite Goddess of love to make the statue real, and she makes his wish come true. This event influenced countless literary adaptations and 
                    inspired countless works of art.<a href="#bib4" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib4')"><sup>[4]</sup></a>

                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Another early example of artificial intelligence can be found in the story of the 
                    <span class="text_hover">Golem</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/7_golem.jpeg"/> 
                    .The Golem is a Jewish folklore in which the entire creature is 
                    created from clay or mud. The most famous one narrates the golem being created by a rabbi in Prague. Golem’s sole nature was mentioned as protective 
                    against its creator and capable of doing tasks as an ordinary being, but it didn't have the power to speak. Unlike Brazen Head, a legendary automaton in 
                    the early modern period.<a href="#bib5" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib5')"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    One personal favorite metaphysical and philosophical mention of artificial creation is in 
                    <span class="text_hover">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/8_upanishad.jpeg"/>
                    ,one of the oldest Upanishads, which 
                    is a part of the Yajur Veda (one of the four Vedas) in the ancient scriptures of Hinduism. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad tries to attain a philosophical 
                    peak by answering challenging and unanswerable questions based on the nature of consciousness, the soul, and the universe. I would like to highlight one 
                    section in which sage Yajnavalkya scrutinizes the thorough nature of consciousness and argues that consciousness is in everything and not limited to the 
                    human mind. This is a deep-seated idea, and it answers fundamental aspects of reality.<a href="#bib6" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib6')"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
                     He says:
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    "Consciousness is not in the eye, nor in the ear, nor the mind, nor the speech, nor the breath, nor the skin, nor the flesh, nor the blood, nor the bones, 
                    nor the marrow. Consciousness is within everything."

                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Here I would like to put up a new thing called an automaton. Not actually new, but have a fundamentally more discrete idea than AI or ALife. Automaton is 
                    a moving mechanical device that imitates a human being. If you argue, in a broad sense, we can define it as a mechanical device that performs a function 
                    according to a predetermined set of coded instructions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Lapsing back to ancient Greece, we can glimpse numerous automatons, from wash basin automatons to windmills. The most attractive of all is the recently 
                    discovered 
                    <span class="text_hover">Antikythera Mechanism</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/9_antikythera.jpeg"/>
                    , a complex astronomical computer built in the 1st century BC. In the same chronicle, we can experience automatons in 
                    ancient Egypt in the form of statues or figurines competent in performing simple actions. But in Ancient China, automata development has a different 
                    story. The 
                    <span class="text_hover">Chinese created various automata</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/29_chinese.jpeg"/>
                    , including mechanical birds that could sing, fish that could swim, and puppets that could perform dances. 
                    The invention of varied automata continued again in the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, One of the most famous medieval automata was built called 
                    the 
                    <span class="text_hover">Strasbourg Clock</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/10_strasbourg.jpeg"/>
                    , a large astronomical clock. Subsequently, the Renaissance saw a renewed interest in automata, and many renowned artists and 
                    inventors designed their own automata. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    For example, the infamous 
                    <span class="text_hover">Leonardo da Vinci</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/11_leo.jpeg"/>
                    sketched a 
                    <span class="text_hover">flying automaton</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/12_leofly.jpeg"/>
                    . The 18th and 19th centuries initiated 
                    a golden age for automata. Many automata were brought into existence during this period, including the 
                    <span class="text_hover">Jaquet-Droz automatons</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/13_jaquet.jpeg"/>
                    , which could write, draw, 
                    and play music. However, in the 19th century, the focus of why automata were developed started shifting to reducing factory physical labor. Continuing 
                    to the 20th and 21st centuries, we saw the development of new and more complex automata.<a href="#bib7" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib7')"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Here I would like to take a little time and argue automatons were just a resemblance of humanly activities, physical or intellectual but didn't pose any 
                    learning skills.
                </p>

                    Writing has shaped the ideology of the general audience for a long time. And we could see similar things happening in the last century. In the last two 
                    centuries, when artificial intelligence was becoming a concept that could be a reality in a few years, we saw some fine literature being published and 
                    influenced by it. Those pieces include 
                    <span class="text_hover">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/30_frank.webp"/>
                    <a href="#bib8" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib8')"><sup>[8]</sup></a>,
                     Karel Capek's R.U.R.<a href="#bib9" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib9')"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, and 
                     Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?<a href="#bib10" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib10')"><sup>[10]</sup></a> These 
                    works try to predict the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. These fiction have a solid resemblance with its characters being monsters, only

                    Thus, artificial intelligence has always been the subject of speculation; some believe it will surpass the human race, and some believe it will revolutionize 
                    the world, solving world hunger. Only the future, with rolling time, will shed light on the visible consequences of this technology. Even then, This might 
                    not be the “artificial intelligence” that we learned it to be. Till now, we have considered an approach to ALife in some way, the idea of creating an 
                    artificial being, a man-made monster. Because people didn't imagine the idea of what artificial intelligence will become in the form of computers,

                    The idea of AI is that computers at the base are computers themselves but with the capability to think and learn from data. In the 20th century, only we 
                    have reached the intelligence peak in all of human history in every field, like psychology, philosophy, etc., to achieve the technological and theoretical 
                    requirements to make AI a reality and the general public getting introduced to abstract flat-screen interfaces.

                    In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction introduced the world to the concept of artificially intelligent robots; the next half century was 
                    the time of a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) making it the reality.

                    One such person was 
                    <span class="text_hover">Alan Turing</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/14_alan.jpeg"/>. Due to his contributions, a movie is out there biographing him called “The Imitation Game,” an amazing piece of art. He 
                    was a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence. Turing came up with a paper in 1950 called “Computing 
                    Machinery and Intelligence,”<a href="#bib11" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib11')"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
                     where he came up with the idea of machines doing the same, solving problems by coming up with reasoning. This paper also 
                    explored “the Turing test,” how to test their intelligence which was based on the indistinguishable conversation between an AI against a human. This 
                    formulated the benchmark for measuring the progress of AI research, but it has been criticized for being human-centered occasionally.

                     The slow development of computers as deep pockets were needed to invest 
                    in them became the reason behind the late entrance of AI. 
                    With the progress in computers, the first AI program was written named “Logic Theorists”<a href="#bib13" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib13')"><sup>[13]</sup></a>

                    marked a milestone in AI’s development. Controversial because it raised a lot of questions about AI’s competence, as Chess was considered the exclusive 
                    domain to humans.

                    Nearly a decade later, Watson<a href="#bib18" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib18')"><sup>[18]</sup></a> was developed by the very same IBM, with the 
                    motive of answering questions to the then popular quiz show 
                    <span class="text_hover">“Jeopardy.”</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/21_watson.jpeg"/> Then 
                    in 2011, it competed against champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, winning the first prize.

                    Google jumped in 2016 with their computer program to hoard some gems of AI to their name. In 2016, 
                    <span class="text_hover">AlphaGo</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/22_alphago.jpeg"/>

                     defeated Go champion Lee Sedol. If you might 
                    not know this game, this game is very complicated compared to Chess. It marked one of the breakthroughs in the development of AI.

                    Now coming to today’s scenario. The hottest topic today, after launching three years back, is OpenAI<a href="#bib20" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib20')"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
                    . The initial release of GPT-3<a href="#bib21" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib21')"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
                    , a large language model, 
                    was able to generate human-quality text and do creative tasks.
                    It was just showing its potential when its successor 
                    <span class="text_hover">ChatGPT</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/23_chatgpt.jpeg"/> was released, which took the internet by storm. These models are still under development, 
                    but they have changed the definition of what AI could do and might revolutionize the field of AI in the future, again. With OpenAI in the competition, 
                    other companies globally, like Microsoft launching 
                    <span class="text_hover">Bing AI search</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/24_bingai.jpeg"/> and Google introducing 
                    <span class="text_hover">Bard</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/25_bard.jpeg"/>, have taken their chance.

                    South Korea has come a long way in the field of AI by implementing AI in a wide range of areas; we can see that in companies like Naver, 
                    Samsung, Kakao, etc.

                    We all laughed nervously over the cartoons and enjoyed movies like 
                    <span class="text_hover">“2001: A Space Odyssey”</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/26_spaceai.jpeg"/> and 
                    <span class="text_hover">“The Terminator”</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/27_terminator.webp"/> portraying AI’s negative capabilities to 
                    harm the human race. It met the end with truth in February of 2023 when Microsoft's Bing threatened a curious student from Germany who tried to put it 
                    to its limits.<a href="#bib22" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib22')"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
                     And this is just one event among much other loss of control self-driving cars meeting with accidents. AI has caused issues like job 
                    displacements, privacy issues (deep-fakes), safety (self-driving car accidents), bias (biased data on the internet used for training), and loss of control.

                    Recently with AI showing its power, OpenAI’s CEO 
                    <span class="text_hover">Sam Altman</span><img class="image_hover" src="./assets/28_sam.webp"/>
                    met with the US Congress to regulate the development of AI.
                    <a href="#bib23" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib23')"><sup>[23]</sup></a> This was to prevent the AI 
                    from being out of control. These systems have become so complex that we can’t predict how they will act whenever the new “updated version” is run. 
                    The same kind of thing happened a few years back when people signed an open letter to stop the development of AI for at least six months.<a href="#bib24" class="bib" onclick="highlightThis('#bib24')"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp
                    Putting my point of view now, I believe the development of AI can’t be stopped. There are many people out there who have invested their lifetime, 
                    millions of dollars into this tech.  But we can try to regulate and restrict the parameters to protect the future. Well, in the end, we are researching 
                    AI to make our life easier and better, the same thing we did not so long ago with computers.
